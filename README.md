E-Mail to SMS Gateway service for Lupusec XT1 alarm system

## Motivation

I happened to know an owner of the very early central alarm system Lupusec XT1 from the German
company [Lupus Electronics](https://www.lupus-electronics.de/en/), which has been declared End Of Life several years ago
and doesn't receive firmware updates anymore. It appears, that the manufacturer isn't particularly proud of this early
revision, as it has become impossible to find resources about it on the company websites (except for the **XT1 Plus**
which is *not* the system I'm talking about, but a newer platform).

The system offers a few methods of notifying the outside world about an alarm event, the one in question being able to
send a classic SMS message to a maximum of two phone numbers. APIs tend to change or become deprecated, and without
firmware updates there isn't much one can do. Which is exactly what happened here; the SMS gateway implementation broke
and thanks to this thing not provide any logs or sources, who knows why. This leaves us with a few different channels to
grab events from: Contact-ID - which I have no idea what that is and what to do with it - and E-Mail.

I decided to abuse the E-Mail functionality to receive alarm (and status change) events by faking an SMTP-Server, which
in turn transforms the mail body and sends it to an SMS gateway in proxy. The application uses .NET 8.0 and is designed
as a Worker compatible with Docker, so it should run on any supported Linux system.

## Supported Systems

The solution has been developed for and tested with the Lupusec XT1 (**not** Plus!) central station running Firmware
version **1.0.89** and LupuServ hosted on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Rev 1.1 (ARM32). Currently two SMS gateway providers
are implemented: [CM.com](https://www.cm.com/about-cm/) and [ClickSend](https://www.clicksend.com/eu/) so you need a
registered account and top up a minimum balance for either of those.

## Features

- Can send messages to more than two recipients (limit of original firmware)
- Stores status changes and alarm events in any MongoDB-compatible database
    - The example compose file uses [FerretDB](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB) with
      the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) backend
    - This way you can automatically keep a log e.g. off-site on what's going on in the monitored premises

## Limitations

Some shortcuts have been taken on purpose while developing this proxy application. As of now I have no plans to rectify
them or focus on additional features.

- SMTP-Server doesn't use authentication, it accepts any username and password
    - This solution is meant to be operated in a firewall-protected private network, and without forced TLS protection
      plaintext authentication is a useless "security" measure anyway. It can be added quite easily though, consult the
      documentation of the SMTP library.
- SMS gateway failures are logged, but no other notification happens
    - SMS delivery errors can occur, like if the credit of the used account is depleted, this should be delivered to
      technical personnel via some way.
- Basic rate limits to mitigate SMS-bombing
    - There's a rate limit in place for alarm mails to protect against unintended message spam. A shortcoming of the
      current implementation is that once the rate limit is hit, the message is dropped and not re-sent.
- Only **German language** is supported and tested
    - I only have access to a German system. From my understanding, the language is hard-coded in
      whatever firmware is applied and can't be changed, and I am not aware of the availability of other languages. As a
      result, the message parsers created via reverse engineering currently only work with the German firmware variant.

## How to build

Here's an example using my own tag (adapt accordingly). Since I plan on running the service on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
Rev 1.1 (ARM32) and build on Windows amd64 we need to specify the correct target platform:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/arm/v7 -t nefarius.azurecr.io/lupuserv:latest .
docker push nefarius.azurecr.io/lupuserv:latest
```

Since the Raspberry Pi has limited computing power, I prefer to build the image on my main PC and just download and run
it on the Pi.

## How to set up

You can choose one of the supported SMS Gateway Providers outlined below:

<details>

<summary>Using CM.com</summary>

- Register an account with [CM.com](https://www.cm.com/)
    - Don't forget to respond to verification SMS and mail
    - Add a balance of at least 15€ (as of time of writing) to unlock the Messaging gateway channel (which allows
      sending messages)
    - Get the Product token/API key for the Messaging gateway

</details>

<details>

<summary>Using ClickSend</summary>

- Register an account with [ClickSend](https://www.clicksend.com/eu/)
    - Get the API Credentials (Username and Token) by clicking the key icon on the top right of your Dashboard

</details>

- Build and deploy this solution to a system of your choice
    - For example, install Docker CE on a Raspberry Pi 2 and use the provided compose file to permanently run it as a
      container. There's plenty documentation out there on how to do that so I will not go into details here.
        1) Rename `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml` and adjust its content accordingly
        2) Rename `appsettings.example.json` to `appsettings.json` and adjust content according to your environment
        3) Run: `docker-compose up -d`
- Configure the E-Mail settings on the XT1 web interface as shown below (I only had access to a German UI so it might
  look different on your system):

- You can use the Test E-Mail function and should be able to see it appear in the logs
- **Optional:** to get Arm/Home/Disarm events sent as status messages you need to explicitly enable them in the PIN
  Codes settings:
